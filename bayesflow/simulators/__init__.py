"""
This module provides the :py:class:`~bayesflow.simulators.Simulator`, which is the base implementation of a generative mathematical model, data generating process.
Its primary function is to sample data with the :py:meth:`~bayesflow.simulators.Simulator.sample` method.
The module also contains several other kinds of Simulators, as well as the function :py:func:`~bayesflow.simulators.make_simulator` to facilitate easy implementation.
